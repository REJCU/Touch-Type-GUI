## What to Implement

To do the error checking - could have a while loop iterating over each individual letter 


## Current Problems 
When pressing enter - If incorrect sentence was entered, cannot (sometimes enter even if sentence was corrected) progress. returns a None-type
TypeError: 'NoneType' object does not support item assignment
